Final Project: Categorizing recipes based on ingredients

Ali Rossi

Consumer interest in preparing food at home, especially among millennials, has grown in past years. Along with this growth have come modern offerings aimed at making home cooking easier, as well as expanding access to recipe content. Home cooks are discovering recipes using video channels, search engines, and social media, and often organizing those recipes using smartphone applications.

With the plethora of recipe content available digitally, however, it can be difficult for home cooks to hone in on recipes that meet their specific craving and/or dietary preferences. If recipe websites and recipe-organizing smartphone applications could use automatic categorization and tagging to classify recipes based on ingredients, home cooks could more easily find relevant recipes and would likely return to these offerings in future.

Use cases:
- Automatic categorization of recipes on recipe sites to enable easier browsing / discovery
- Automatic tagging of recipes in recipe organizing smartphone apps to enable users to later search for recipes meeting specific criteria

Recipe categories: This project will focus on cuisine categories; future models may be built to determine dietary preference categories (i.e., Paleo, Vegan) and even user-defined categories (i.e., “healthy,” “brunch”).

Using a Kaggle dataset containing ingredients and cuisine classification for individual recipes, we will create a model prototype to predict cuisine categories for recipes based on ingredients. The Kaggle dataset contains recipes across 20 cuisine categories, but for the purposes of this project, we will use a subset of recipes spanning 5 cuisine categories.
